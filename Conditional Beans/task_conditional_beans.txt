Create a spring boot application that periodically checks and prints the weather temperature
from either Google or Amazon servers.

the weather server should be defined in application.properties file

e.g
weather.server=GOOGLE

the application must print the following logs:
Checking weather temperature from google server...
The temperature is: 15C

e.g
weather.server=AMAZON

the application must print the following logs:
Checking weather temperature from amazon server...
The temperature is: 20C

note:
Create TemperatureChecker interface and 2 concrete implementations
At any point in time, there must be only 1 TemperatureChecker bean in IOC container
Use @Scheduled annotation to check the temperature every 5 seconds
